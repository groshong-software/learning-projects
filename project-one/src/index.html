        <hr>
        <p class="indent-5 ml-1 mt-5">What is the stereotype around Destiny 2 players smelling so bad? Well it may be
            rooted
            in
            truth more than
            you
            think,
            recent studies have shown that they are actually hydrophobic meaning they repel water and with that also
            soap.
            They are too busy with their elitist clan that wants 100+ clears on a raid that came out the day before,
            go outside bro, you are going nowhere in life no one likes you your parents hate you everyone hates you
            actually
            now that I think about it, everytime I mention you everyone goes "who?" or "oh that weird sweaty destiny
            nerd
            that smells super bad and gross and drools alot?" and then I say yes because you do smell very bad.
            Anyways, one shower can go a long way and you gross little Destiny players should tune into the next
            section
            of
            this article for a list of steps in raid language on how to shower.

                <li>Your gross sweat soaked clothes is a status effect and you need to debuff, to do so go mid
                    bathroom
                    and
                    cleanse by taking your gross clothes off.</li>
                <li>Go to damage (mid shower) and throw down Well (turn the shower on) and just start melting that
                    boss
                    (your odor).</li>
                <li>Soap is another status effect that won't proc until you get out of the shower, to avoid this,
                    cleanse in
                    damage by stepping on mid plate (rinsing off).</li>
                <li>Once again you will be hit with a status effect (Hypothermia) if you do not cleanse in mid
                    bathroom
                    by
                    stepping on plate (drying off with your probably gross and sweaty towel).</li>
